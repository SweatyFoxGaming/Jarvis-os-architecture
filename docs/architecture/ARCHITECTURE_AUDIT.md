# Architecture Audit – Jarvis OS

**Date:** 2026-07-15  
**Phase:** XI – Sprint 1  
**Status:** Complete

---

## Executive Summary

Jarvis OS has reached architectural maturity. The codebase is large (~98 core modules, ~15 capabilities, multiple platforms) and has grown organically. Overall, the architecture is coherent and well‑governed, but several areas would benefit from targeted refactoring.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Python modules (src/) | 98 |
| Total dependencies (edges) | 221 |
| Circular dependencies | 0 |
| Layer violations | 2 |
| Major platforms | 10 (Infrastructure, Capability, Execution, Cognitive, Executive, Interaction, Environment, Evolution, Ecosystem, Observation) |

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ No circular dependencies detected.
- ✅ Layer separation is mostly respected (only 2 minor violations).
- ✅ Platforms are well‑defined and follow single‑responsibility principles.
- ❌ Several modules have grown beyond their original scope (e.g., `mind.py`, `api.py`).
- ❌ The Workspace is a **God Object** – it attempts to hold too many contexts.
- ❌ Some abstractions are unnecessary or duplicated.
- ❌ Observability and explainability are limited – many operations are silent.
- ❌ Testing coverage is low – no formal test suite exists.

## 1. Platform Ownership & Boundaries

| Platform | Owner | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Infrastructure** | `src/core/`, `src/bridge/`, `src/infrastructure/` | Stable – provides foundational services. |
| **Capability** | `src/capabilities/` | Well‑defined; providers and registry are clean. |
| **Execution** | `src/execution/` | Scheduler, planner, retry logic – clear separation. |
| **Cognitive** | `src/cognition/` | Knowledge, learning, reflection – good encapsulation. |
| **Executive** | `src/executive/` | Mind, intent, goals, strategy, planning, decision, delegation – mostly clear, but `mind.py` is large. |
| **Interaction** | `src/interaction/` | Manager, session, conversation, personality – well‑structured. |
| **Environment** | `src/environment/` | Domains and providers – clean abstraction. |
| **Evolution** | `src/evolution/` | Analyzers, recommendations, forecasting – well‑defined. |
| **Ecosystem** | `src/ecosystem/` | Plugin lifecycle, registry, sandbox – clear separation. |
| **Observation** | *Not yet implemented* | **New platform** proposed for Phase XI. |

**Minor Violations:**
- `src/memory/executive_memory.py` imports `src.executive` – layer violation.
- `src/executive/mind.py` imports `src.memory` – bidirectional coupling.

**Recommendation:** Move `executive_memory.py` out of `src/memory/` or remove the import from `mind.py`.

## 2. God Objects & Over‑large Modules

The following modules are > 1000 lines and should be decomposed:

| File | Lines | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `src/api.py` | ~800 | Contains all endpoints – should be split by domain (chat, notifications, voice, evolution, ecosystem). |
| `src/v2_main.py` | ~600 | Engine initialization – could be broken into smaller bootstrapping modules. |
| `src/executive/mind.py` | ~500 | ExecutiveMind is the orchestrator – contains fast‑path, ReAct loop, research, and direct command handling. |
| `src/core/tools.py` | ~300 | Capability registry – could be split into registry, execution, and handler resolution. |

**Workspace is a God Object (conceptual):**
- `CognitiveWorkspace` (in `src/cognition/workspace.py`) currently holds:
  - current goal
  - current task
  - conversation history
  - capability results
  - metadata
- This violates single‑responsibility: the workspace should be split into **contexts**.

**Recommendation:** Refactor Workspace into:
- `GoalContext`
- `ConversationContext`
- `ExecutionContext`
- `KnowledgeContext`
- `CapabilityContext`
- `EnvironmentContext`
- `ReasoningContext`

---

## 3. Duplicate Concepts & Unnecessary Abstractions

- **`src/core/registry.py`** and **`src/capabilities/registry.py`** – two separate capability registries. The `capabilities` registry should be the primary source of truth; the `core` registry can be a thin wrapper.
- **`ToolRegistry`** (in `src/core/tools.py`) is essentially a capability registry with a different name.
- **`DepartmentRegistry`** is used only for scheduling – could be integrated into the execution platform or removed if not heavily used.

**Recommendation:** Merge or clarify the role of these registries; deprecate one if possible.

---

## 4. Observability & Explainability

- **Events** are published via `EventBus`, but many critical operations (goal creation, planning, delegation) do not emit events.
- **Tracing** is present in `ExecutiveMind` via `collect_trace=True`, but not used consistently.
- **Health** is implemented for plugins but not for core platforms.

**Recommendation:** Introduce an `Observation` platform in Phase XI to unify telemetry, tracing, health, and audit logging.

---

## 5. Testing

- **No formal test suite** exists (no `tests/` directory with unit or integration tests).
- `src/main.py` runs some demos, but they are not automated.

**Recommendation:** Create `tests/` directory with:
- Unit tests for each platform.
- Integration tests for end‑to‑end flows.
- Simulation tests for executive decisions.

---

## 6. Performance & Scalability

- **Startup time**: ~2–3 seconds (acceptable).
- **LLM inference**: ~1–2 seconds per request – fine.
- **Graph updates** (UI): currently simulated – needs to be event‑driven.
- **Event throughput**: EventBus is in‑memory and synchronous – could become a bottleneck under load.

**Recommendation:** Profile startup, planning, memory retrieval, reflection, graph updates, and event throughput. Optimize bottlenecks.

---

## 7. List of Duplicate or Unused Modules

- `src/executive/ceo.py` – seems unused (delegated to `mind.py`).
- `src/executive/state_machine.py` – possibly redundant; `ExecutionState` enum is used directly.
- `src/memory/librarian.py` – might be duplicated by `knowledge_librarian.py`.

**Recommendation:** Review and remove dead code.

---

## 8. Next Steps (Sprints 2–5)

1. **Sprint 2 – Simplification & Ownership**
   - Remove dead code.
   - Clarify platform ownership (document).
   - Merge duplicate registries.
2. **Sprint 3 – Interfaces & Workspace**
   - Introduce interfaces for platforms.
   - Refactor Workspace into contexts.
3. **Sprint 4 – Observation & Explainability**
   - Implement `src/observation/` with telemetry, metrics, tracing, health.
   - Add decision traces.
4. **Sprint 5 – Testing, Performance & Polish**
   - Build test suite.
   - Profile and optimize.
   - Polish UI (voice, animations, graph, notifications).

## 9. Approval

This audit is a planning document. **Implementation will begin after approval.**

**Action:** Review this report, discuss priorities, and confirm the Sprint 2 plan.
